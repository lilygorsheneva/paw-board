# PAWBOARD

A chorded keyboard using pressure sensitive resistors and bluetooth. 

> NOTE: In the project's current state it barely works, and a significant fraction of it is hastily tweaked esp32 sample code. 


> WARNING: This uses unauthenticated BLE pairing, and is vulnerable to MITM attacks. Do not use this for anything sensitive (have your devices forget this device after you're done playing with it).
